## Love Nikki English/French Server Story Chapter High Scores

Please be sure to read through and make sure you understand all this info. If you have questions, feel free to ask me (Eigencat)!

### General Info:
* When updating the public version of the spreadsheet, I'd like all chapters to be roughly equally up-to-date. I don't want, for example, to publish a sheet where chapter 12 is three days out of date even if all the others were updated today. This way rankings aren't skewed for or against anyone who has been focusing on a particular chapter.
* Update the high scores whenever you wish, but consider prioritizing chapters which have been waiting longer to be updated.
* Ideally I'd like to publish an update weekly, but don't feel pressured to update if you're busy. Your life is more important than Love Nikki high scores!

### Do:
* Only edit the chapter-specific tabs of the spreadsheet (`Chapter 1`, `Chapter 2`, etc). Within those tabs, **only** update the `Name` and `Last updated` columns.
* Put your name, the chapter you updated, and the date on the `Instrucitons & Check-in` tab.

---

### DON'T:
* Edit `Home` or `Clean Home`. Those tabs collect data from the chapter-specific sheets on their own.
* Go in and specifically update levels where you just ranked up. To keep things consistent and unbiased, let's update entire chapters at a time.
* Edit the tables on the right in the chapter tabs. These columns are just the first step of data processing and will update on their own.
* **IMPORTANT** pleeeease do not drag existing names elsewhere. This can be tempting, especially if the highscores have just shifted one spot, but it breaks the code which does the counting.
* **IMPORTANT** do not share this copy of the high-score spreadsheet with anyone. If it becomes public or gets into the wrong hands, we could lose our hard work.# LN-Ranks
